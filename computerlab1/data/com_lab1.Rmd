## Data structures 

In R every element is regarded as an object. Objects are data structures that group data according to specific attributes. Most general data structures are organised by two elements

  - Dimensionality 
  - Type of the contents (homogeneous, heterogeneous)
    
      1. **`numeric or character`**: single number of letter
      
      2. **`Vector`**: 1 dimension, homogeneous objects.
      
      3. **`List`**: 1 dimension, heterogenous objects - (different objects grouped together)
      
      3. **`Matrix`**: more than 1 dimension, homogenous objects 
      
      4. **`Data frame`**: more than 1 dimension, heterogenous objects. 
      
  

## Data structures: examples 


 This is a `vector`
```{r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}

v =c(1,2,3,4)
v
```

 This is a `list`
```{r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}

l = list(c(1:5), c("a","b","c", "d", "e"))
l
```

This is a `data.frame`
```{r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
df = data.frame(numbers = c(1,2), letters = c("a", "b") )
df
```

## Data frames 

`data.frames` are the most common data structure for gathering information.

  - **Variables**: Collect different arguments associated with the information to be analysed - diffrent formats (numbers, strings, factors, dates, ...)
  - **Observations**: Units of analysis (individuals, firms, etc...) - e.g. the rows of your dataset.
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
setwd("/Users/Personas/My Cloud/PhD _october_2016/teaching/NBS8186/data")
nba = import("nba.csv")
 nba[1:5, 1:7]
```
   

## Before you start

In the (likely) case of crisis

  + Specialised websites - e.g. [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
  + [R Mailing lists](https://www.r-project.org/mail.html)
  + `help`, `help.search()`, `??(name package/name function)`

## Programming your analysis

Why writing code?

- Helps to keep track of what you are doing. 
- Reduces the sources of error.
- Increases your productivity and efficiency - similar code for differnet analyses.
- Enhances collaborations.

R language 

- Packages contain libraries that perform functions. 
- Functions are composed by arguments. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, include=TRUE}
df = data.frame(numbers = c(1,2), letters = c("a", "b") )

```

## Task 1: Load the data in R

There are two possible ways to input information: 

- *Manually*
- *Import* from somewhere

 The majority of the analyses import data: 

- Data are delivered in different formats.
- Important to understand how the information is structured. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# working directory
setwd("your_PC/comp_lab1") 

install.packages("") # for installing packages 
library("") # for loading libraries

```

## Task 1: Load the data in R'cont

**QA**: _Download the data set from Blackboard and save it on your h: drive. Then open the data set in R and make it the default data set._

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# working directory
setwd("") 

install.packages("") # for installing packages 
library("") # for loading libraries

# loading data 

read.csv()
import() #'rio() package'

```

## Task 2: Preliminar exploratory analyses 

```{r include = TRUE, echo =TRUE}

nba = read.csv("nba.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)

```

- How is the structure of your data? 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE}

head(df) # gives the first lines 

tail(df) # gives the last lines

str(df) # types of variables
  
```

## Task 2: Summary 

**QB**: _Have a look at the summary statistics of the data set. What is the average age of the players?_

- `summary()` is used to get a summary statistics of the variables in your data frame.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE}

summary(nba) # also referred to variables  

```

- An alternative way to obtain the average age would be by calling directly the variable `age` using the operator `$`. 

```{r include = TRUE, echo =TRUE}

mean(nba$age) 

```


## Task 2'cont: Counts of categories

**QB cont'**: _How many play forwards?_

- What class of data is `forward`?
- `table()` summarises the number of categories in a factor.^[There are alternative and more efficient ways to carry out this task. `data.table` and `dplyr` are the most suited packages when there are bigger samples.].

```{r include = TRUE, echo =TRUE}

table(nba$forward)

```

## Task 2'cont: Histograms 

**QC**: _Plot a histogram of points-per-game._


```{r include = TRUE, echo =FALSE}

# Histogram 

    # xlab = rename the axis X
    # main = title of the plot      
    
hist(nba$points, xlab= "points", main = "Histogram of points")
  
```

## Task 2'cont: Histograms 

- `hist()` is the simplest way for plotting a histogram.^[Package `ggplot2` offers a wide range of histograms and other plotting alternatives.]


```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE}

# Histogram 

    # xlab = rename the axis X
    # main = title of the plot      
    
hist(nba$points,
     xlab= "points",
     main = "Histogram of points")
  
```

## Task 2'cont: Scatterplots 

**QD**:_Produce a scatterplot of points-per-game versus years in league._

- Scatterplots represent the association between two variables.
- A way of doing it is by using function `plot()` and `with()` to _attach_ the data frame and use the variables independently


```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE}

# Scatterplot 

    # xlab = rename the axis X
    # ylab = rename the axis Y
    # main = title of the plot      
    
with(nba, plot(points, exper, 
               xlab= "points", 
               ylab = "experience", 
               main = "Scatterplot of points vs 
               experience"))

```

## Task 2'cont: Scatterplots

```{r include = TRUE, echo =FALSE}

# Scatterplot 

    # xlab = rename the axis X
    # ylab = rename the axis Y
    # main = title of the plot      
    
with(nba, plot(points, exper, xlab= "points", ylab = "experience", 
               main = "Scatterplot of points vs experience"))


```

## Task 3: Regression models 

**QE**: _Run a regression of points-per-game on years in league, age, years played in college and position dummies._

- We need libraries `stats` and `AER`
- `lm` estimates a linear model using ordinary least squares (OLS). 
-  The variable before "` ~ `" indicates the dependent variable whereas the variables in the right side are considered the set of explanatory regressors. 
-  `model1` is a fitted-model object.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE, message = FALSE}

library(stats)
library(AER)

 model1 = lm(points ~ exper + age + coll +
               forward + center, 
               data = nba)
 
 summary(model1)
```

## Task 3: Regression models 

What can we say of our fitted model? 

- Experience has a statistically significant influence in the perfomance - an additional year of experience implies 1.4 additional points per game.
- Age and years playing at college (`coll`) play a negative role (Question F)
- All the coefficients are jointly signifcant. 

## Task 3: Correlation matrix 

**QG**: _Look at the correlation matrix_

```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE, message = FALSE}

library(Hmisc)
library(dplyr)

# select variables from the model 
vars_mod = nba %>% select(exper, age, coll,
                          forward, center)
    # note: subsetting using pipes 

# correlation matrix 
cor_mat <- rcorr(as.matrix(vars_mod), type = "pearson")
emphasize.strong.cells(which(cor_mat[[3]] < 0.001,
                             arr.ind = TRUE))

```

## Task 3: Correlation matrix 

**QG'cont**: _Do you need to worry about multicollinearity?_

- How is the Pearson correlation coefficient?
- Is this correlation significant?


## Task 3: Generate new variables 

 **QH**:_Generate a new variable which is experience squared and include it in the regression._
 
 - Simplest solution^[This solution includes a base package. Yet, `dplyr` presents more flexible options for creating various variables under a number of conditions] - e.g. indexing 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE, message = FALSE}
 nba$expersq =nba$exper^2
```

**QH'cont**: _Holding age, coll, center and forward fixed, at what value of experience does the next year of experience reduce points-per-game?_

```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE, message = FALSE}
  
# include 'expersq'
model2 = lm(points ~ exper+expersq+age+coll+
               center+forward, 
              data = nba)
 
```

## Task 3: Transform variables 


- Sometimes we need to transform variables. 
- Log transformation is normally used.
- Interpretation of coeficients may change. 

**QI**:_Now you want to explain the log(wage)_

```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE, message = FALSE}
 nba$logwage = with(nba, log(wage))
```

- `model3` is expressed as follows 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE, message = FALSE}

# include 'logwage'
model3 <- lm(logwage~points+exper+expersq+age+coll, 
             data = nba)
```

## Task 3: Transform variables cont'

_How do you interpret the results?_

 A log transformation in the depedent variable in this case will interpreted as a percent change. 
 
- Points obtained would suppose an increase of 7% in the wage.
- An additional year of experience would suppose an increase of the 22.3%. 

## Task 3: Model comparison - ANOVA test 

**QJ**:_Test whether age and coll are jointly significant in the regression from (i). What does this imply about whether age and education have a separate effect on wage, once productivity and senority are controlled for?_

```{r eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE, message = FALSE}


mod_unrest <- lm(logwage~points+exper+expersq+
                   age+coll, data = nba)
mod_rest <- lm(logwage~points+exper+expersq, data = nba)

anova(mod_rest, mod_unrest)
```

## Recap 

- Writing code helps to control the workflow. 
- Loading data depends notably on how what type of format you have - normally is `.csv`.
- There are different ways to access data in R. Common ways are through  `$`and functions such as `which`.
- It is important to understand how to define the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Also, variables may have transformations and it can have implications in terms of interpretation.
